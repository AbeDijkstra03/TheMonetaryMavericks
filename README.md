# TheMonetaryMavericks

This GitHub repository is created for the course Project Computational Science at the University of Amsterdam. It includes the code for a model that simulates the housing market using an agent-based model and looks at the results of the average house prices. Furthermore it checks what the impact is of interest rates on the prices.

The file simulation model.ipynb is the working model that simulates the housing market that is validated and well.
The file Attempt to model bidding (no final model).ipynb was an attempt on another more complicated variant of the model. That model is not validated however, so it's not used as the final model.
The csv files are necessary for running the models, because the data in it is used in the models.
The images folder includes some visualizations created using the model.
All code is written in a Jupyter Notebook, which uses the programming language Python.

To run the model, the libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib, mesa and seaborn must be installed.
